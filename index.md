The **Tudor and Stuart Ireland Conference** will take place in University College Dublin on Friday and Saturday, 2â€“3 September 2011.

Early Modern Ireland is a flourishing field of research and this conference will provide all scholars interested in the period with an opportunity to share their ideas in an interdisciplinary forum.

The conference is part-funded by the [UCD Graduate School of Arts and Celtic Studies](http://www.ucd.ie/artsceltic/graduateschool/) and further supported by the [UCD Humanities Institute of Ireland](http://www.ucd.ie/hii/) and [UCD School of History & Archives](http://www.ucd.ie/history/).   

### The Call for Papers is now closed.
